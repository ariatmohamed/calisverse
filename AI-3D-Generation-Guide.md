## 📋 Usage Instructions

### Step 1: Choose Your AI Platform
- **Meshy AI** (recommended): Best quality, $20/month
- **Spline AI**: Free tier available, web-based
- **Rodin AI**: Advanced features, higher cost

### Step 2: Copy Exact Prompts
- Copy the prompt exactly as written
- Don't modify unless you want specific changes
- Use one prompt per model generation

### Step 3: Generate Multiple Versions
- Generate 3-4 variations of each equipment type
- Try different style additions for variety
- Save the best results for your project

### Step 4: Download in Correct Format
- Request **GLB** or **GLTF** format
- Ensure file size under **5MB**
- Check that textures are included

## 💡 Pro Tips for Better Results

### Prompt Optimization:
- Be specific about materials (steel, rubber, foam)
- Include realistic dimensions and proportions
- Mention "professional gym quality" for better detail
- Add "realistic lighting" for better rendering

### Iteration Strategy:
1. Start with basic prompt
2. Add details gradually if needed
3. Generate multiple versions
4. Combine best elements from different results

### Quality Check:
- ✅ Verify all parts are included (grips, brackets, hardware)
- ✅ Check proportions look realistic
- ✅ Ensure materials appear correct
- ✅ Test file size and format compatibility

## 🔗 Integration with CalisVerse

### Loading AI Models in Three.js:
```javascript
// Add to landing.js
const loader = new THREE.GLTFLoader();

loadAIModel(modelPath) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        loader.load(modelPath, (gltf) => {
            const model = gltf.scene;
            model.traverse((child) => {
                if (child.isMesh) {
                    child.castShadow = true;
                    child.receiveShadow = true;
                }
            });
            resolve(model);
        }, undefined, reject);
    });
}
```

### Model Replacement System:
```javascript
// Replace procedural models with AI-generated ones
async replaceWithAIModel(productType) {
    const modelPath = `models/ai-generated/${productType}.glb`;
    try {
        const aiModel = await this.loadAIModel(modelPath);
        // Replace existing model in scene
        this.scene.remove(this.currentModel);
        this.scene.add(aiModel);
        this.currentModel = aiModel;
    } catch (error) {
        console.log('Fallback to procedural model');
    }
}
```

## 🚀 Next Steps
